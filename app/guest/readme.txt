This is the guest route. I fear there was a lot of confusion regarding if should we implement Guests as members with logins
and should they be able to see the amount of meetings they've used. And we put it in the artefact agreement as a core feature.
So here it is, it's very low effort and basic. It's mostly here as a criteria that we may ore may not need, it can be easily removed
(just change the code in the login route to deny users logging in with guest accounts.)
